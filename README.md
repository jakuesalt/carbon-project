# carbon-project
this project is trying to cover a need I don't think is covered today: 
- easily calculating not only the carbon footprint that I have
- a good level of detail in the most important contributors to it
- focussing on the parameters that I can take action more (like travel, vs. my house heating) 
- specially, being able to play with parameters to understand "what if" scenarios and their eventual impact on the carbon footprint. For example "what if I did this trip by car instead of plane", "what if I bought an electric car", "what if instead of eating beef three times per week I reduced to once everty two and had chicken instead more often?"
- Provide a way to calculate small actions impact. I cancelled this flight, I did not eat meat today, when I was planning to, and extrapolate that data in time (you will be saving x amount of co2 in the next 10 years if you continue this trend)
- Possibly provide a more positive approach to the problem, instead of focussing on the bad part, CO2 emissions, look at it from the positive side, trees planted. You are actually not planting any trees, but considering that a tree can capture around 1T of CO2 during its life span, we can measure our CO2 reduction in terms of trees planted which will cretea a positive feedback to the user of the tool.
- Address the local data issue, and the exessively US based approach of most calculators.Starting with a specific to Switzerland. A lot of the data about the type of heating, the green energy proportion of the electric bill (and therefore as well how green the electric cars really are) are specific to the country we live in, and not having these specifics vcovered by current tools can have a deterring effect on the potential users of these calculators. 
- Eventually, making the code available and parameters used, the tool could be extrapolated to other countries.
